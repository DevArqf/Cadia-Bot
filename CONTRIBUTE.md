# How to contribute to @Cadia#5418

You should always make a new branch on the github repo (<https://github.com/DevArqf/Cadia-Development>) when adding a new feature and you should follow a naming scheme for the branch.

The naming scheme should be:

-   `feature/featureName` for new features
-   `bugfix/bugName` for bug fixes
-   `enhancement/enhancementName` for enhancements

When you are done with your feature, bug fix, or enhancement, you should make a pull request to the `main` branch.

**You should always branch from the `main` branch and not from any other branch.**

After you make a pull request, you should wait for a review from the maintainers of the repo. If the maintainers approve your pull request, it will be merged into the `main` branch and your changes will be live on the bot.

If the maintainers do not approve your pull request, they will leave a comment on the pull request with what you need to fix. You should fix the issues and then make a new commit to the branch. After you make a new commit, the maintainers will review your pull request again.

### How do i make a branch?

This part assumes you are using vscode.

Vscode makes it really easy to make a new branch using the built in git features. You can check your activity bar (the bar on the left with all the icons) and search for a git icon. Click on the git icon and you should be in the source control tab.

Then you can click the 3 dots on the top right of the source control tab and click on `Branch` > `Create Branch From...` and then select `main` on the menu that pops up. You can then name your branch and click enter.

### How to do local testing

To do local testing, you should use a seperate bot token for your local bot. You should not use the bot token for the main bot for local testing. You can get a bot token from the Discord Developer Portal (<https://discord.com/developers/applications>).

The bot token should be put in a `.env` file in the root of the project. The `.env` file should look the one named `.env.example` in the root of the project. You should replace `TOKEN` and `MONGO_URL` with your bot token and your MongoDB URL. Although you should already have the mongodb url link sent to you by one of the bot owners.

Make sure to .gitignore the .env file so that it is not uploaded to the github repo.

### How to push to prod

To push to prod, you should make a pull request to the `main` branch. After the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch and your changes will be live on the bot.

You dont need to push your `.env` file as there will already be an existing one on the server.
